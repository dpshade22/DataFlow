# DataFlow Backend
This is the backend for DataFlow, a user-friendly, web-based data automation application that streamlines data processing tasks for businesses and individuals.

## Getting Started
To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and the necessary Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Install Julia and the necessary Julia packages by running julia install.jl.
4. Copy the .env.example file to .env and modify the environment variables as needed.
5. Initialize the Flask app by running flask run.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
backend/

```

## API Routes
The following API routes are available:

- `/api/signup` - Signup a new user
- `/api/login` - Login an existing user
- `/api/import` - Import data into DataFlow
- `/api/export` - Export data from DataFlow
- `/api/clean` - Clean data using Julia functions
- `/api/transform` - Transform data using Julia functions
- `/api/integrate` - Integrate data with third-party tools using Julia functions
- `/api/schedule` - Schedule data processing tasks for automated execution
- `/api/user` - Manage user account information

## Data Processing
Data processing tasks are handled by Julia functions in the data_processing/ directory. These functions can be called from Python using the PyJulia package. To add new data processing functions, create a new Julia file in the data_processing/ directory and add the functions to the __init__.py file.
